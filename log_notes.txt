Notes:

- Thermal test 20171020_183001__fullBrickBurnIn: divided to cycles and each cycle with steps
- File saved at end of each steps if done
- In cycle 1 step 3, Initialize 6 bricks
- step 4 has errors and never complete (it change state from ColdStart to MinPwr)
- step 5 Initialize 6 bricks again, and it skips to step 7
- the steps that follow are repeatedly checking something about ADC reading and temperature of plate for each brick
- In step 161, state change to Off and system is power off
- Steps after this just do nothing except print state Off
- In step 281, system tried to power on (state changed to ColdStart) and initialize 6 bricks, but some errors happen
- After some repeated tries, it complete step 281.
- Some error happen again, and the next step done is 285 (reading in ColdStart state), then repeat reading
- In step 301 it change from ColdStart to FullPwr5Vref, but that caused errors.
- When errors happen it re-Initialize 6 bricks, but the state is kept (does not go back to MinPwr)
- step 303 Initialize 6 bricks, and then skip to step 305
- then starts checking/reading again
- step 721 changed back to MinPwr, then reading again, changed to off in step 781
- step 901 changed to ColdStart, errors happen, done after some retry
- Some error happen again, and the next step done is 904 (reading in ColdStart state), then repeat reading (same as earlier state change)
- step 921 changed to FullPwr5Vref, then read in this state (no exception errors this time)
- step 1341 changed to MinPwr, then read in this state (no exception errors this time)
- step 1401 changed to Off
- step 1521 changed to ColdStart, initialize 6 bricks.
- step 1541 to FullPwr5Vref, step 1961 to MinPwr, step 2021 to Off
- step 2141 to ColdStart (one hour off)
- step 2161 to FullPwr5Vref, step 2581 to MinPwr, step 2641 to Off
- step 2761 to ColdStart (one hour off)
- step 2781 to FullPwr5Vref, step 2581 to MinPwr, step 2641 to Off
- After some repeated above, it go back to some errors, paused stages, etc...
